# Ignite Gym

Ignite Gym is a mobile application developed using React Native with Expo framework and NativeBase package. The purpose of this project is to assist users in tracking their gym exercises, categorizing them by muscle groups (back, biceps, triceps, etc.). Additionally, it provides users with animated gifs demonstrating each exercise, along with recommended sets and repetitions. Users can mark exercises as completed and view a detailed daily exercise history.

## Key Features

- **Exercise Tracking:** The app allows users to log their gym exercises, categorized by muscle groups such as back, biceps, triceps, etc.
- **Exercise Visualization:** Users can view animated gifs demonstrating how to perform each exercise, along with information about recommended sets and repetitions.
- **Exercise History:** Completed exercises are recorded and organized into a daily history, enabling users to track their progress over time.
- **Profile Update:** Users have the ability to update their profile information, including name, password, and profile picture.
- **Refresh Token:** In case the authentication token expires, the app automatically refreshes the token to ensure uninterrupted user experience.
